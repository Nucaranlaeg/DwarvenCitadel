==================================================
Overview
==================================================

Player starts with 7 dwarves, whose goal is to survive as long as possible.
Dwarves have 4 actions:
 * Mine
 * Build
 * Upgrade
 * Research
The dwarves dig deeper and deeper into the mountain and slowly construct a fortress
for themselves to prevent their enemies (orcs, goblins, etc.) from reaching them.
They can build and improve various kinds of weaponry and traps that function independently,
find gems to add more magical effects to their machines, and find exotic metals that
allow for powerful defenses.

==================================================
Dwarves
==================================================

Each dwarf has his specialty, developed by practice.  The more a dwarf mines, for example,
the better he gets at it.  Dwarves have one skill per action.
When you have a dwarf selected, you can see his level in each skill, and you can disable one
or more skills so that the dwarf doesn't work on things that he's not good at.  Dwarves
preferentially choose tasks that are closer to them and that they're better at.

==================================================
Mining
==================================================

When a dwarf mines, he carves more space into the mountain for the dwarves.  Each tile mined
gives one stone, in addition to potentially finding ore or gems.  While obtaining ore and gems
is random, both become more frequent the deeper your dwarves dig.

==================================================
Construction
==================================================

There are many structures to build.
 * Traps injure any enemy which walk over them.  They typically do less damage and have stronger
   effects than other constructions, and they can only attack a given enemy once.  They cannot be damaged.
  ** Spike trap: Deal a little damage, slow an enemy.  No cooldown.
  ** Swinging ball: Deal a little damage, stun for a brief time.
  ** 
 * Towers fire projectiles at nearby enemies.  While towers have unlimited ammo, they are more effective
   if they have been recently serviced by a dwarf.  Towers block the path.
 * Walls do nothing except block the path.  When a dwarf has no path outside, he slowly suffocates
   (though this damage, unlike normal damage, recovers over time).
